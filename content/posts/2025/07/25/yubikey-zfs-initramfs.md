If you're running an encrypted ZFS root filesystem on Debian and want to
enhance boot-time security with hardware-backed two-factor authentication, the
**yubikey-zfs-initramfs** extension is a robust solution. It introduces a
YubiKey-based challenge-response mechanism into the initramfs stage, ensuring
only users with both the correct passphrase and physical key can decrypt the
system.

## What Is This Repository?

The GitHub repository **[tschaefer/yubikey-zfs-initramfs](https://github.com/tschaefer/yubikey-zfs-initramfs)** provides a Debian
package that integrates with `zfs-initramfs` and adds support for unlocking an
encrypted ZFS root using a YubiKey. It uses a **challenge-response mode** where
your boot-time passphrase is verified *in combination* with a YubiKey.

* **Language**: Primarily Shell script
* **License**: GPL-3.0
* **Platform**: Debian/Ubuntu with ZFS and initramfs-tools

## How It Works

During boot, your system prompts for a passphrase. This passphrase is used as a
"challenge" to the YubiKey, which must be inserted and activated (touched).
The YubiKey responds with a cryptographic value that is validated against
stored metadata, unlocking the encrypted ZFS root volume.

This effectively creates a two-factor setup:

1. Something you **know** (your passphrase)
2. Something you **have** (your YubiKey)

## Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. **Download the Debian package**

   * Visit the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/tschaefer/yubikey-zfs-initramfs/releases) and download the latest `.deb` package.

2. **Install the package**

   ```bash
   sudo dpkg -i yubikey-zfs-initramfs_*.deb
   sudo apt-get install -f  # Resolve any dependencies
   ```

3. **Set up YubiKey challenge-response in Slot 2**

   ```bash
   ykman otp chalresp --generate 2
   ```

   * This will configure Slot 2 for challenge-response mode, required for boot-time unlock.

4. **Enroll your YubiKey**

   * Run the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo /usr/sbin/yubikey-zfs-enroll
   ```

   * This will prompt for your ZFS passphrase (entered **interactively**) and link it to your YubiKey.
   * For advanced options, consult the [manpage](https://github.com/tschaefer/yubikey-zfs-initramfs/blob/main/yubikey-zfs-enroll.8.md).

5. **Update your initramfs**

   ```bash
   sudo update-initramfs -u
   ```

   * This step ensures that the yubikey unlock hook is included in your system's boot process.

## Usage at Boot

After setup, during system boot:

* You are prompted to insert and touch your YubiKey.
* You're asked to enter your ZFS encryption passphrase.
* The combination unlocks your ZFS root volume.

If the YubiKey is missing or incorrect, or the passphrase doesn't match, the
root volume will not decrypt.

## Why Use It?

* **Stronger Boot-Time Security**: Combines hardware and passphrase.
* **Minimal Dependencies**: Uses native initramfs hooks and shell scripts.
* **Avoids LUKS**: Works directly with native ZFS encryption.

## System Requirements

* Debian-based system with encrypted ZFS root
* YubiKey with Slot 2 available
* `zfs-initramfs` and this package installed

## Limitations

* Only **single YubiKey** support is expected.
* Passphrase is required **interactively** at boot—no automated unlocking.
* No TPM or remote unlock support; this is strictly a local 2FA enhancement.

## Conclusion

`yubikey-zfs-initramfs` provides an elegant, hardware-backed way to unlock ZFS
encrypted root filesystems at boot. With a single Debian package and a setup
script, you can bring your system one step closer to true two-factor security
at the hardware level.
